regression.ipynb

 This code provides our regression analysis of the IMDB dataset. It first finds the most popular actors in the dataset and finds their average ratings. Then it moves on to a simple linear regression of the data. In this section we test average ratings with a series of attributes in the dataset including run time and start year.
 
 
two_way_anova.ipynb

 This code provides the ANOVA testing for several attributes of the IMDB dataset. The chief relationship we looked at here was between ratings and genre, with additional attributes including number of votes and runtime. We found that there was only little variance due to the genre attribute. This leaves us with the conclusion that genre and ratings are very weakly correlated.
